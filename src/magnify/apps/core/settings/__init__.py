"""
Default settings for the Magnify core app.

If you use Django Configuration for your settings, you can use our mixin to import these
default settings:
    ```
    from configurations import Configuration
    from magnify.apps.core.settings.mixins import MagnifyCoreConfigurationMixin

    class MyConfiguration(MagnifyCoreConfigurationMixin, Configuration):
        ...
    ```

Otherwise, you can just use the usual Django pattern in your settings.py file:
    ```
    from magnify.apps.core.settings import *
    ```
